@chaxreports,"ANI should have sent a warning to Mohak Mangal and other youtubers regarding ""copyright strike"" for using ANI's footage without license before actually going for the strike. 
The point is setups like these is exactly done to facilitate extortion. It is a shame that the copyright strike is done unilaterally and now the Judge is working at their behest by not asking relevant questions like this. Evidently a lot of things are at stake.",1,2025-05-31T07:21:40Z,Negative

@OrangeArmy-r1w,Ye to aisa ho gaya ki ANI pure duniya me ghum ghum ke News aaye aur fair use ka loophole nikal ke log 10 sec se niche ka video daal ke paise kama le. Use karne se pahle baat kar lo unse lekin nahi jab unka reaction aayega tab rona macha denge. Jis ANI ka source of Income hi subscription pe tika hua hai waha se bhi tumhe free me hi chahiye to wo kya bhandara laga de kya.  Baki News channel ka use kar lo koi issue mahi hoga lekin ANI aur PTI subscription basis pe hi chalte hai to wo kya free me hi baat de sabko. Mohak ho kya dusre politcal creators wo samaj seva to kar nahi rahe wo bhi to kama hi rahe hai na. Dono ke bich communication ache se hona chahiye tha. Dono ne bahut galti ki hai mamle ko jyada uchal ke. Saare social media pe log ANI ko gariyane lag gaye the jabki galti Mohak ki bhi thi to wo to case karenge hi apne reputation bachane ke liye,1,2025-05-30T10:18:41Z,Positive

@chiluxr250,Indian judges should remember that our pharma industry developed  based on the principle of fair use. We basically ripped off large corporations of their medicine forumulas and made generic medicines. It was their research in first place. Without fair use their won't be any generic medicines in India. Fair use is most important part of any progresive society.,21,2025-05-30T09:20:57Z,Positive
